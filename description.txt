This mod adds some more functionality to the Staff of Regrowth, making it able to place grass of almost any type, such as mushroom grass, corrupt/crimson grass, jungle grass, and ash grass.
To place corrupt/crimson/hallowed grass, right click on soil (or mud if in glowing mushroom biome). You must already be in that biome to place the grass of the biome type.
Left clicking mud in the jungle will place jungle grass, and left clicking ash will place ash grass in hell.
